                                Recovering EC2 if SSH is lost
We have to create a recovery instance to set a fresh ssh keys. 
•	first we need to detach the volume from the lost(ssh key) ec2 instance.
•	Then attach the volume to the ec2 which has ssh(pem key)
•	After that we need to mount that volume using commands.
	mkdir recovery
	mount /dev/xvdf1 recovery
	cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys > home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
	cat home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
Note : while reattaching to the ec2 we need to change root device name
